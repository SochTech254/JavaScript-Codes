Research on :
	JS OOP : Aggregation, Composition

JavaScript has OOP capabilities like Encapsulation, Aggregation, Composition, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

Aggregation :
	A "uses" B = Aggregation : B exists independently(conceptually) from A
	example :
		Let say we have objects : "address", "student", "teacher"
		We want to specify "student address" and "teacher address"
		Then we can reuse "address" between "student" and "teacher" 

Composition :
	A "owns" B = Composition : B has no meaning or purose in the system without A
