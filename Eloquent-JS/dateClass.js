/* 
JavaScript uses a convention where month numbers start at zero (so De-
cember is 11), yet day numbers start at one. This is confusing and silly. Be
careful.
The last four arguments (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) are op-
tional and taken to be zero when not given.

Timestamps are stored as the number of milliseconds since the start of 1970,
in the UTC time zone. This follows a convention set by “Unix time”, which
was invented around that time. You can use negative numbers for times before
1970. The getTime method on a date object returns this number. It is big, as
you can imagine.

Date objects provide methods such as getFullYear , getMonth , getDate , getHours, getMinutes , and getSeconds to extract their components. Besides getFullYear there’s also getYear , which gives you the year minus 1900 ( 98 or 119 ) and is mostly useless.
Putting parentheses around the parts of the expression that we are interested
in, we can now create a date object from a string.
