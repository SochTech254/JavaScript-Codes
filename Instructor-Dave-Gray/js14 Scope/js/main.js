// var, let and const

// var belongs in the legacy code
// x is printed in the console as holding value 2
var x = 1;
var x = 2;
console.log(x);

// let is mainly used in initialization when the variable will require to be re-assigned another value
// const is mainly used when defining a constant and its value cannot be changed

// There are two main scopes: global scope and local scope
// Local scope has two types block scope inside{} and function scope
